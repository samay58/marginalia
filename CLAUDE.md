# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Product shape

Marginalia is a disposable macOS review surface for agent-written drafts:

1. a hook notices a draft file,
2. the app opens,
3. the user edits inline and optionally saves rationales,
4. the app writes a 7-file bundle,
5. the agent reads `summary_for_agent.md`.

The desktop review model is a three-pane layout: change rail (left), manuscript editor (center), rationale surface (right). Compact layouts swap the rationale column for a popover.

Selecting an edit is browse mode. Composing a rationale is explicit (button or `Cmd+/`).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # marketing site only (localhost:1420)
pnpm tauri dev        # desktop review app at /review (requires Rust toolchain)
pnpm tauri:build:app  # build .app bundle
pnpm tauri:build:dmg  # build DMG release artifact
```

Validation (run all before shipping):

```bash
pnpm run check:diff         # diff ID retention
pnpm run check:annotations  # annotation model invariants
pnpm run check:semantic     # semantic diff correctness
pnpm run check:bundle       # bundle artifact completeness
pnpm run check:hook         # hook async queue behavior
pnpm run check:lint         # lint model checks
pnpm run check              # Svelte type checking (svelte-check)
pnpm run build              # production frontend build
```

Each `check:*` script is a standalone regression test in `scripts/`. `pnpm run check` is Svelte type checking, not a test runner.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 5 (Svelte 5 runes), adapter-static in SPA mode (no SSR)
- **Desktop shell**: Tauri 2 (Rust). The Rust layer is intentionally thin: file I/O, bundle persistence, CLI arg parsing, window lifecycle. All review logic lives in the frontend.
- **Editor**: Milkdown (ProseMirror-based markdown editor)
- **Diffing**: `diff-match-patch` on rendered plain text, not raw markdown
- **Layout tuning**: `dialkit` provides live-tunable CSS custom properties via `DialStore`
- **Animations**: `motion` (Framer Motion for JS)

## Architecture

### Route structure

Two route groups under `src/routes/`:

- `(marketing)/+page.svelte` serves the landing page at `/`
- `review/+page.svelte` serves the desktop review app at `/review`

The root layout (`+layout.svelte`) sets `data-marginalia-mode` to `review` or `site` based on the current path. Tauri's window config points directly at `/review`.

### Core data flow

1. Rust reads the markdown file and exposes it via Tauri commands.
2. The frontend stores original and edited markdown plus their plain-text projections (`src/lib/stores/app.js`).
3. Diffing runs on the plain-text projections (what the user actually sees), not raw markdown.
4. Annotations resolve against the latest diff using a conservative policy: exact match, heuristic reattachment, or stale.
5. On finalize, the frontend generates the bundle and Rust persists it to disk.

### Primary files

- `src/routes/review/+page.svelte` — app orchestration, recovery, keyboard shortcuts, selection/composer state, bundle finalization
- `src/lib/stores/app.js` — document state, plain-text projections, derived diff/annotation stores
- `src/lib/utils/diff.js` — stable text diff with ID retention across edits
- `src/lib/utils/annotations.js` — annotation records, target metadata, reattachment scoring, stale resolution
- `src/lib/utils/bundle.js` — bundle generation (format `3.0`)
- `src/lib/components/Editor.svelte` — Milkdown host, persistent note markers from resolved annotations
- `src/lib/components/ChangeRail.svelte` — left-side change index (visible changes only)
- `src/lib/components/AnnotationColumn.svelte` — desktop rationale workflow
- `src/lib/components/AnnotationPopover.svelte` — compact-layout rationale UI
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — native file/bundle I/O, CLI parsing, window commands

### Annotation model

- `annotations` is an array of stable records, not a map keyed by change ID.
- Each record stores target metadata: prior change ID, excerpt, line context, block key.
- Resolution is conservative: exact match first, heuristic reattachment second, otherwise `stale`.
- Stale notes must never silently drift to a new edit.

### Session lifecycle

- Sessions begin when a file is loaded. Autosave snapshots go to `~/.marginalia/sessions/`.
- Recovery restores: content, plain-text projections, saved annotations, selection state, general notes, in-progress rationale drafts.
- Finalizing writes a bundle and clears the active session marker.

## Important behavior contracts

- Diffs are computed from rendered plain text, not raw markdown.
- Whitespace-only changes are filtered from the visible review surface.
- Clicking inserted text in the manuscript must behave like normal editing. Only deletion widgets remain click-intercepted.
- Selecting an edit must not focus or reopen the rationale composer.
- Saved manuscript markers are keyed by stable annotation IDs and grouped by block, not mutable geometry buckets.

## Bundle contract

Bundles are written to `~/.marginalia/bundles/[timestamp]_[filename]/`.

Contents:

- `original.md`, `final.md`
- `changes.json` (format `3.0`), `annotations.json` (schema `3.0`)
- `changes.patch`
- `provenance.json` (schema `1.0`)
- `summary_for_agent.md` (primary agent input)

## Hook system

`hooks/post-write.sh` is a Claude Code post-write hook with single-instance queueing.

Trigger rules (default):
- file ends with `-draft.md`
- file contains `<!-- REVIEW -->`
- `MARGINALIA_REVIEW_REGEX` env var overrides both

Key env vars: `MARGINALIA_REVIEW_MODE` (sync/async), `MARGINALIA_QUEUE_DIR`, `MARGINALIA_BIN_OVERRIDE`.

The hook enqueues requests and processes them one at a time. It writes a status JSON, then emits a hook response directing the agent to read `summary_for_agent.md`.

## Environment notes

- Vite dev server is hardcoded to port `1420` (Tauri expects it).
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` uses `"closable": true`; close interception happens in `+page.svelte` via `onCloseRequested`.
- Version bumps must stay aligned across `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
